# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm that works in ```O(nlogn)``` time. ```O(nlogn)``` is one of the fastest time complexities a sorting algorithm can achieve.

---
Firstly, merge sort splits up original in half using recursion into, the algorithm will reduce an array of length ```n``` into ```n``` subarrays of length of one. For each of the subarrays, we will merge them in order in ```O(n)``` time.
