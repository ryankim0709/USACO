# De Brujin Sequences
A **De Bruijn Sequence** is a string that contains every string of length `n` exactly once as a substring, for a fixed alphabet of `k` characters. The length of such a string is `k^n + n - 1`. If `n = 3` and `k = 1`, then the sequence is `0001011100`. In this sequence there are the substrings `000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `...`, `111`. Interestingly enough, each De Bruijn Sequence corresponds to an Eulerian path. The point is to create a graph such that each node contains a string of `n-1` characters and each edge adds one character to the string. An Eularian path in this graph would correspond to a string that contains all strings of length `n`.
