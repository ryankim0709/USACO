# Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm that *"takes the best course of action"* at every step. Due to this property, greedy algorithms are generally much faster than compelte searches. Although there are no formal ways to prove greedy algorithms work for all cases, there are some exceptions where there are mathematical or logical proofs.
