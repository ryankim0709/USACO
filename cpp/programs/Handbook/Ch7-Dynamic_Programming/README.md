# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique that combines *correctness of complete search* **and** *the efficiency of greedy algorithms*.  Dynamic programming is usually applied to problems that can be divided into overlapping subproblems which can be solved independently.


Two main uses of dynamic programming
    - Finding an optimal solution
    - Counting the number of solutions

The goal of dynamic programming is to implement **memoization** which is the idea of using answers from past subproblem to efficiently solve the current subproblem.
