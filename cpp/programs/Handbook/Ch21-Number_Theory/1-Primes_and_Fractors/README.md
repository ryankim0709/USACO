# Primes and Factors
`a` is a **factor** or **divisor** of `b` is `a` divides into `b`. We write `a | b` if `a` is a factor of `b`, and `a âˆ¤ b` if `a` is not a factor of `b`.

If `n > 1` and if the positive factors of `n` are `1` and `n`, then a number is **prime**. Some examples are, `7, 19, & 41`. The **prime factorization** is a number `n` is writing `n` in terms of prime numbers. For example, the prime factorization of `84 = 2^3 * 3 * 7`.

## Number of primes
It has been determined that there are an **inifinite** amount of prime numbers.

## Denisty of primes
The density of primes is how often a prime number occurs in a range of numbers. Let `d(n)` denote the number of primes between `1` and `n`. For example, `d(10) = 4` because `2, 3, 5,& 7` are primes from `1-10`. This number `d(n)`, is approximated to be, `d(n) = n/ln(n)`.

## Conjectures
A conjecture is something that has been accepted to be true, but has not been proved.

* Goldbach's Conjecture: Each number `n > 2` can be expressed as `n = a + b` where `a` and `b` are both prime numbers.
* Twin Prime Conjecture: There are an infinite number of pairs `{p, p + 2}` such that `p` and `p + 2` are prime.
* Legendre's Conjecture: There is always a prime number between `n^2` and `(n + 1)^2`, where `n` is a positive integer.

## Basic Algorithms

```cpp
// Determines if a number is prime
// We just need to try to divide all numbers until sqrt(n), and if any are divisible, then the number is not prime

bool prime(int n) {
    if(n < 2) return false;

    for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if(n % i == 0) return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

```cpp
// We are finding all positive factors of number n
// We will divide n by all possible prime factors, then add them to a vector if the remainder is 0

vector<int> factors(int n) {
    vector<int> f;

    for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        while(n % i == 0) {
            f.push_back(i);
            n /= i;
        }
    }

    if(n > 1) f.push_back(n);
    return f;
}

```

## Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a preprocessing algorithm that will build an array to efficiently check whether a given number `2 ... n` is prime or not. We will go through the array starting from index `2`, and if `sieve[i] = 0`, then `i` is prime, and we mark `2i, 3i, 4i, ..., ni` with `i` since `i` divides `n`
